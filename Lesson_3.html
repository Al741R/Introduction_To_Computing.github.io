                                enterprise-sized organization. Enterprise information begins with the day-to-day
                                transactions that occur within the company, such as sales receipts or time cards. The
                                company gathers and stores the information. Over time, employees collect, combine, and
                                analyze the information. Ultimately, the role of information gathered in this way is to allow
                                managers to make better decisions. Managers are responsible for coordinating and
                                controlling an organization's resources. Resources include people, money, materials, and
                                information.

                                    process transactions faster, reduce clerical cost, and improve customer service. Examples
                                    of transactions are deposits, payments, orders, and reservations. Transactions take place
                                    in real time. Early TPSs mostly used batch processing. With batch processing, the
                                    computer collects data over time and processes all transactions later, as a group. As
                                    computers became more powerful, system developers created online transaction
                                    processing information systems. With online transaction processing (OLTP), the computer
                                    processes each transaction as it is entered.
