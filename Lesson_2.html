                            <p class="Paragraph">3. <strong>Configuration Mistakes</strong> - a misconfiguration that enable hacker to gain access to your internal system.</p>
                            <p class="Paragraph">4. <strong>Poor Cyber Hygiene</strong> - Habits and practices regarding technology use, like avoiding unprotected WiFi networks and implementing safeguards like a VPN or multi-factor authentication.</p>
                            <p class="Paragraph">5. <strong>Ransomware</strong> - Hacker captures sensitive data or takedown networks and demand payment to restore payment.</p>
